W5. R Programming Challenge - Computing a Rolling Mean

Write a function roll.mean(x,k) where x is the input vector and k is the number of observations to use to compute the rolling mean.  The function should output a vector of rolling means.  Components of the output vector where a rolling mean cannot be computed should contain the value NA.

Post your R function and a test function call using an input vector of all 1's.

```{r}
v = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
mean(v[1:2])
roll.mean = 3
for (i in 1:3){
  print(mean(v[1:i+1]))
}

```
