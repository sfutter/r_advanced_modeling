This examples show that by using a max (-ve AIC) as fitness function it is possible to use the GA as a means to subset variables of interest in a model. The revised subset variable model may perform better than a naive model (perhaps this is expected...).

# This example is from Section 4.5 of 'GA: A Package for Genetic Algorithms in R';

#install.packages('GA')
#install.packages('UsingR')
library(GA)
library(UsingR)


data('fat', package='UsingR')
head(fat)
# help(fat) will provide the data dictionary


lm.1 <- lm(body.fat.siri ~ age + weight + height + neck + chest + abdomen + hip ++
		+ thigh + knee + ankle + bicep + forearm + wrist, data=fat);


summary(lm.1)

# Extract the design matrix and drop the intercept;
# This is a matrix of our predictor variables;
X <- model.matrix(lm.1)[,-1];

# Extract the response vector;
Y <- model.response(model.frame(lm.1));
# head(model.frame(lm.1)) to view the header of the model frame;
# The model frame is just a data frame of predictor variables and 
# the response variable;



# Write an R function to compute the model fitness;
# Note that I have written this function slightly differently from the example;

fitness.aic <- function(string){
	inc <- which(string == 1);
	X.inc <- cbind(1,X[,inc]);
	lm.inc <- lm.fit(X.inc,Y);
	class(lm.inc) <- 'lm';
	value <- -AIC(lm.inc);
	return(value)
	}

# Note that the smallest AIC is the best fit, hence we want to minimize the AIC;
# The ga() function will maximize the fitness so we need to pose our problem correctly
# with respect to maximizing fitness means maximizing the negative of the AIC.

# From the look of this function we should be expecting string to be a binary string
# consisting of 0 and 1 like 00001010101010.

# Now use the ga() function to optimize the fitness() function and select a 
# model based on AIC.

ga.aic <- ga('binary',fitness=fitness.aic,nBits=ncol(X),names=colnames(X),monitor=plot);

plot(ga.aic)
summary(ga.aic)


# Fit the solution using lm();
lm.2 <- lm(body.fat.siri ~ age + weight + neck + abdomen + hip ++
		+ thigh + forearm + wrist, data=fat);

summary(lm.2)
AIC(lm.2)
